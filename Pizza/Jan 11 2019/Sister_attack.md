# 1.11.19 - Sisters-in-law Shabbat Attack

Made the NY pizza recipe from Ken Forkish's `Elements of Pizza`, yielding 3 NY style (thin crust, crispy rim, floppy middle) pizzas.

### Dough

Used `King Arthur Bread Flour`, and Forkish's `48-72 hr pizza dough` recipe. 

Mixed up in the `6 qt tub`, with dough at an `81 degree` temperature. Let it rise for 2 hours. 

Thought it was maybe a bit low / inactive. But had to start shaping.

### Sauce

Did the `Elements of Pizza` NY pizza sauce:

```
> San Marzano tomatoes
> Chili flakes
> Chopped garlic
> Sugar
> Oregano
```

Delicious. 

### Shaping

Shaped it into 3 balls, which were maybe not tight / high enough. Then on a dinner-plate with plastic wrap.


### Cold ferment

Did this incorrectly. 

`Elements of Pizza` calls for a 48 hour rest period, but our social plans messed the timing up. Had to take it out after just one day.

Let the balls rest for 90 minutes, which made the dough very pliable and good!


### Baking - Pizza #1

First pie was half vegan cheese, half mozz. 

`500 degree` oven, with the `Broiler` on high for 5 minutes prior to loading.

The launching went better than expected. 

Baked for `10 minutes` exactly. 

Turned out spectacular.

### Baking - Pizza #2

Majorly fucked up. Oven situation.

Got it all prepped and ready on the pizza peel â€” but the oven shut off!

Had to wait until the oven got back up to temperature. About 25 minutes. And meanwhile the prepped pizza was just sitting on the peel, congealing and sticking to it.

Had to perform an emergency operation. Dusting the bottom of the peel with lots of flour, shunting a spatula underneath, desperate to be able to launch it onto the pizza steel.

Launching went terrible. Pizza ended up looking like Minnesota.

But it tasted okay. Though the bottom was completely dusted in raw flour.

### Baking - Pizza #3 

This one was the winner. Excellent. 

Cleaned the flour. Did a classic mozz + parmesan. Turned out beautiful!

### Next time: 

I wouldn't change a damn thing, except for the oven malfunction.
