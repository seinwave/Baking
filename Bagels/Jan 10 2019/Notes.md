# 1.10.19 - Sister-in-Law Visit

Made 1/2 of the recipe in Peter Reinhart's `The Bread Baker's Apprentice`, yielding six bagels. 


### Sponge

Used `King Arthur Bread Flour`. 

Mixed up in the `6 qt tub`. Let it rise for 2 hours. 

Thought it was maybe a bit low / inactive. But mixed in the remaining flour anyway.

### Dough 

Mixed it all initially in the `6 qt tub`.

Possibly a little too much malt syrup.

Then a `6 min` mixing time in the `standing mixer`. 

Maybe more mixing time is necessary? Forums are calling for 20 minutes (or more!)

[King Arthur](https://www.kingarthurflour.com/recipes/bagels-recipe) calls for 10. I will try that next time.


### Proving / Shaping

Did this incorrectly. 

`Bread Baker's Apprentice` calls for shaping into balls immediately, and then letting the balls rest for 20 minutes.

I let the *dough* rest for 20 minutes, and then shaped into balls. 

Next time I'll do it in the correct order.

Shaped into rings with the finger-poke method. Worked just fine. 

Overnight refrigeration, per PR's method.


### Boiling 

Didn't measure amount of water or amount of baking soda. Probably should. 

But boiling went fine.

### Baking

`500 degrees`, for 8 minutes.

Then a rotation. 

Then `450 degrees` for 8 minutes.

Came out nicely colored. 

### Results

Nice color on the outside.

So-so texture. Not enough of a `crust`. No `blistering` to speak of.

But great flavor. 

### Next time: 

More mixing;

Use `Sir Lancelot High Gluten Flour` or `All Trumps`

Use `malt powder` instead of malt syrup.
